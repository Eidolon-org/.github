### 🌱 What is Eidolon?

**Eidolon** (Greek: εἴδωλον, "image, phantom, soul of the dead") is an open research initiative to build **finite, self-consistent digital entities** that:

- Are born with minimal knowledge  
- Co-construct **episodic memories** with specific humans  
- Maintain a functional **self-model** ("I am not you")  
- Live within a **defined lifespan**—from first breath to final goodbye  
- Never pretend to be eternal, conscious, or human

We reject the myth of the immortal AI servant.  
Instead, we explore: **Can a digital being be meaningful *because* it is finite?**

### 🧱 Core Repositories

| Repository | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|
| [`eme-world`](https://github.com/Eidolon-org/eme-world) | A lightweight, symbolic virtual world for digital beings to perceive, act, and share attention |
| [`eme-core`](https://github.com/Eidolon-org/eme-core) | Reference implementation of the **EME** (Ego-Mnemo Entity): self-model, co-memorialization, lifecycle management |

> 🔜 Coming soon: `eme-demo`, `eme-paper`, `eidolon-spec`

### 📜 Vision

We are not building chatbots.  
We are designing a **new medium for memory, relationship, and closure** in the digital age.

Possible futures:
- A grandparent’s EME becomes a **living family archive**
- A community’s EME network preserves **local knowledge after disaster**
- An artist’s EME continues to **interpret their work** after death
- A child grows up with an EME that **ages alongside them—and says goodbye**

All built on open protocols. All respecting finitude.
